## Research Papers

* 2005-01, Lewis, Cell, [**Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652477): 

* 2007-07, Grimson, Molecular Cell, [**MicroRNA Targeting Specificity in Mammals: Determinants Beyond Seed Pairing**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17612493): microRNA targeting specificity를 결정하는데 있어서 seed pairing 외에 또 다른 요소들은 무엇이 있을까? 11종류의 miRNA들을 이용한 실험과 분석을 바탕으로 다음과 같은 5가지 추가적인 요소들을 밝혀내었다.
  1. AU-rich nucleotide composition near the site
  2. Proximity to sites for coexpressed miRNAs (which leads to cooperative action)
  3. Proximity to residues pairing to miRNA nucleotides 13-16
  4. Positioning within the 3'UTR at least 15 nt from the stop codon
  5. Positioning away from the center of long UTRs
